    <h1>Assignment 9.3: JavaScript - Part 1</h1>
    <p>
        I really enjoy working my vehicles because they allow me to problem solve at depths I did not imagine. For instance, it may seem very easy and simple to "<span id="span1">_______</span>" on a car. But once under the car, you have to think of all the possibilities that may go wrong, but not portraying a negative mindset. Simply just being ready.</p>
    <p>
        For example, before I had my 2006 Jeep Cherokee, I had a 2015 Chevrolet Sonic. And let me tell you, I loved that car. It saved tons of gas, was small, practical and could fit anywhere in a parking space in the city. But to "<span id="span1">_______</span>" I needed a special tool. A tool I had to buy at the local "<span id="span2">_______</span>".
    </p>
    <p>
        As far as my Jeep Cherokee, I don't need any tools except for "<span id="span3">_______</span>". This makes me appreciate different cars and the "<span id="span4">_______</span>" behind certain cars a lot more than others. Because some are made to be simply and others are complicated.

    <button type="button" onclick="document.getElementById('span1').innerHTML = firstVariableValue">"change an oil"</button>
    <button type="button" onclick="document.getElementById('span2').innerHTML = secondVariableValue">"auto parts store"</button>
    <button type="button" onclick="document.getElementById('span3').innerHTML = thirdVariableValue">"one ratchet"</button>
    <button type="button" onclick="document.getElementById('span4').innerHTML = fourthVariableValue">"engineering"</button>
